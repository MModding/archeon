## 🏷️ Welcome to Archeon: Rebirth of History

The Silent Winds team presents the Archeon mod! Archeon is a brand new dimension, full of new blocks, mobs and more! All you need to get there is a portal made of Mysterious Stone, filled with a magical energy made by the Wand of Nature! The Archeon mod is still in heavy development, but we just released the Rebirth of History update a few days ago! Go check it out on CurseForge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/archeon-quilt/files - Some newer versions might also be released in a few days to fix some bugs! This version of Archeon is only for Quilt, meaning it is not compatible with the Forge version.
