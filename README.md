The dimension is accessible through the making of a portal, which can be built using the new "Mysterious Stone" block, in the same way as a Nether Portal. It can then be ignited with a "Wand of Nature" item, to access the dimension.

## FAQ

#### About Minecraft Version Supports

**Q** - Will this project ever support \[enter older Minecraft version\]?
**A** - No sorry, it's taking time for us to manage the currently supported version of the mod, retrograding it just
makes a lot of stuff harder.

**Q** - Will this project ever support \[enter newer Minecraft version\]?
**A** - Yes it will, except if we're too late at catching newer versions, then we might skip a few minor ones.

#### About Platform Supports

**Q** - Will this project ever support **FabricMC**?\
**A** - What???

**Q** - Will this project ever support **QuiltMC**?\
**A** - It's one of our goal to support it with the native FabricMC version of the mod. If something is not working,
please report it to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MModding/archeon/issues) (or the one of our
[library](https://github.com/MModding/mmodding-library/issues), depending on the issue you encounter).

**Q** - Will this project ever support **NeoForge**?\
**A** - We're considering it, it may happen in the future.

**Q** - Will this project ever support **Former Forge**?\
**A** - That's a big, very big **NO**. (We just do not like to work with it.)

#### About Documentation

**Q** - Does the project have a **Wiki**?\
**A** - We're working on [this Wiki for the mod](https://wiki.mmodding.com/archeon), it might not be complete at the
moment, but we're filling it as times goes on.

#### About Rights

**Q** - Can I publicly distribute **Project X** under my ModPack?\
**A** - **Yes, of course.** As long you are not redistributing jar files directly, you are allowed to. (So by using standard redistributing ways in CurseForge packs or Modrinth packs).

**Q** - Can I port this project to any Minecraft version/any modloading platform?\
**A** - **No.** Our projects are under the PolyForm Shield 1.0.0 License for code which only allows users to view and contribute to the source, neither fork to not contribute back nor port it. That is a choice we have made as we consider these are ways to steal our work, while we still want other people to be able to contribute to our projects or be able to look at some parts of our code to understand how we make something inside of it. Assets are always All Rights Reserved, you do not have any rights on them.

#### About Accessibility

**Q** - Can I translate the mod to \[insert any language\]?\
**A** - Yes, of course! It helps us make the mod more accessible for everyone! Thank your very much for that!
