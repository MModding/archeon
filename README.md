## Overview

Archeon is a brand-new liveable dimension, featuring new building blocks to use, creatures to discover and structures to explore!

The dimension is accessible through the making of a portal, which can be built using the new "Mysterious Stone" block, in the same way as a Nether Portal. It can then be ignited with a "Wand of Nature" item, to access the dimension.
