Plus, I can sell them to the villagers easily here, they seem to make tools and gear out of them, probably by combining them with obsidian, I think?

I believe it's a common animal here. Although, their meat is delicious!\n\nWhat the hell is this? I just managed to find a sort of flying blue and purple creature!

  "loreData.archeon.heart_of_nature.desc": "I have never seen it, but some people here were talking about a big flying thing above a gigantic tower made of Aketite. The beast is apparently named \"Heart of Nature\", a mysterious legacy from hundreds of years ago...\n\nIt's from what I heart, not a friendly creature, deploying Aurora Catalysts to kill you even more easier...\n\nPersonally, I believe it is just a story for kids and not a real thing, it is obvious for me. Maybe I am wrong? And day or another, we will see.",
  "loreData.archeon.wood.title": "Wood",
  "loreData.archeon.wood.desc": "Wood is essential here, I have to take some, but I'm lost, there are so many different types of them! Palms, Vuxancias, Cypresses, Neclanes... unless their different colors, they don't seem to have any really particular things to note.\n\nPalms are probably the rarest of them, which can only be found in the flat areas of the Archeon's dunes.\n\nThe cypress wood is very bright, Vuxancia is very dark, Neclane is a bit orange like Palm but more vibrant, and though, I love them!",
  "loreData.archeon.lusonyth.title": "Lusonyth",
  "loreData.archeon.lusonyth.desc": "Sometimes, I am trading with the villagers of this continent. They are clam and nice to everyone. They gave me a present, with a sort of gemstone, blue and big gemstone, a bit darker than Exyriane.\n\nAfter I asked, they answered me it is a Lusonyth gemstone, and it can be smelt to obtain a heavy ingot! From what they told me, this material is only used to make tools and armors and to combine it with Clementium things. Lusonyth tools and sword are nice, although they needs everytime a reparation with gems, and they are rare. Maybe I could make money.",
  "loreData.archeon.apaflorite.title": "Apaflorite",
  "loreData.archeon.apaflorite.desc": "Oh! I found small pink gems on my way! It is a very resistant material, that I used to make my armor, my sword and my newer tools, and from merchants I heard, it is called Apaflorite. They look freakin'shiny and it is not that a rare material, so all is good with them!\n\nI find them more and more in every cave of this continent, and it this material looks like a small diamond. My gear is now heavy but really more efficient than nothing, I would say!\n\nI recommend them, really, but maybe I can find even better in this land?",
  "loreData.archeon.exyriane.title": "Exyriane",
  "loreData.archeon.exyriane_desc": "I found beautiful crystals in a small cave on my way! Their bleu shimmers are always nice to see, the Exyriane gems! Apparently, they can be used as fuel but are not that durable. They can also bu sued to make torches, to get bit of light! It is a quite mysterious thing, because they are very easy to break, but very resistant against fire. From what I heard, some people used its power to make sort of rituals about magic, and many other reasons explaining why, when I approach one of them, I am somehow afraid of a danger. Anyways, I am using them to light my way, now!",
  "loreData.archeon.seashells.title": "Seashells",
  "loreData.archeon.seashells.desc": "Oh! Look at those cute little seashells I found in the dunes! There are yellow, red, and blue ones! I used them to make dyes and colored tiles, for the roof of my house! Crimson, Warped, Red, Ochre... So many colors can be made!\n\nI can also make a collection of them, yes, that's a bit useless, but who cares! After all, these are some many on the beaches of this land.\n\nThough it is not the most useful thing I have even seen in this world, I would say, obviously! But, I still recommend them for tiles.",
  "loreData.archeon.stones.title": "Stones (Part 1/2)",
  "loreData.archeon.stones.desc": "Finally, I am starting writing about the stones types in the Archeon continent. Found really a bunch of new rocks!\n\nFirst, the Southstone, a bright and gray stone which is everywhere, it is a solid rock, used for architecture like columns, pillars...\n\nThere is also the Artemnite, a bright beige rock I found. It is not that different form limestone, like it is used for really everything. It is cool to carve them into bricks, or ornate them with a bit of Exyriane making it looking so cool!",
  "loreData.archeon.stones_sequel.title": "Stones (Part 2/2)",
  "loreData.archeon.stones_sequel.desc": "Writing again about the stones of this land - I found three new ones!\n\nThe Gypsum, a very cool and really bright stone used mainly for making floors.\n\nThe Aketite, honestly the darkest stone I have ever seen in my life, almost black, but also a bit gray. It is used for literally everything, and is very common unlike Gypsum which is rarer.\n\nThis is proudly all the stones I found, maybe there are mores.",
  "loreData.archeon.sunstradiver_and_snail.title": "Sunstradiver and Snail",
  "loreData.archeon.sunstradiver_and_snail.desc": "The Sunstradiver - Apparently a quiet small bird with beige and red feathers that seems to dislike heifers. I heard some people saying you can make good arrows from its feathers! I will do that for sure, it is not really good to kill animals I know, but have to survive in this mysterious land.\n\nThe Snail - Another very quiet small animal, apparently living in all areas of Archeon, unless the Peaks I found on my way. They seems quite big and of course passive.",
  "loreData.archeon.the_panopticon.title": "The Panopticon",
  "loreData.archeon.the_panopticon.desc": "Mmh... This underground cave is very large. I do not know if I will found something interesting here, though. I know from some people the existence of a monument named \"Panopticon\", which is a large building, dating of past centuries.\n\nIt is not a common and not a rare building, and some of them were transformed into museums for presenting treasures found in them. Apparently they were prisons, but a sort of revolution absolutely buried all of them into the depths of the land.",
  "loreData.archeon.the_tower_of_atmosphere.title": "The Tower of Atmosphere",
  "loreData.archeon.the_tower_of_atmosphere.desc": "Whoa! What the hell is this gigantic dark tower I just found!? I am really far away of the nearest village from what the map I have is indicating me. It also seems that this large perimeter was never explored before? Wait, it is obvious. It s a perfect representation of the Tower of Atmosphere, from children stories!? So all of these things were true... I think I will just not going into it, or I will just die!",
